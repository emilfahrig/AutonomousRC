# AutonomousRC
I created this project because of my interest for machine learning and computer vision. A convolutional neural network runs on a computer and sends predicted steering directions to an on-board arduino via a bluetooth module. The motor is powered with respect to the steering directions sent to the bluetooth module to navigate the chalk track.
